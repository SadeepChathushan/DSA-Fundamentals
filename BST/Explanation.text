# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C.
The program supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversals
(inorder, preorder, and postorder).

## Features

- Insert a node into the BST
- Delete a node from the BST
- Search for a value in the BST
- Inorder traversal
- Preorder traversal
- Postorder traversal
